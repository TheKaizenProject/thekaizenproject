  Hi, I’m Marissa Wang, a grade 11 student at Bayview Secondary School. I spend
  my free time crocheting, baking bread, obsessing over my houseplants, and
  making some of The Kaizen Project’s marketing material. I’ve been trying (and
  failing) to get back into reading, so if you have any good book
  recommendations or if you would just like to chat, feel free to reach out!
