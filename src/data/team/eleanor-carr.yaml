  The Kaizen Project is a podcast discussing student life and career exploration
  through meaningful conversations with older students, mentors, and industry
  professionals. The podcast and our other initiatives were started last year
  under Illuminare, a Junior Achievement company based in Markham run entirely
  by a group of 19 driven highschool students. Illuminare recently won the
  Company of the Year award from Junior Achievement Central Ontario for placing
  as the top social enterprise out of the 53 other youth companies and 1100+
  other entrepreneurs in the program. As such, core members of The Kaizen
  Project have stepped up to continue the podcast even after the program has
  ended and some of our executives have graduated.
