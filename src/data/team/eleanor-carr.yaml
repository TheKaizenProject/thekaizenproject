  Hi my name is Paul Andega, a grade 11 student at Thornhill Secondary School in
  Thornhill, ON. There's not a lot I can say I particularly enjoy doing, but
  they're is also not much I really hate doing either. Which is why I can say
  that one of the activities I do enjoy is trying out new things, just like the
  Kaizen Project! I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and love trying to
  go out of my comfort zone. But when I'm not doing those things, you can find
  me either staying up late binging anime and finishing assignments I
  procrastinated on or chilling with some music.
