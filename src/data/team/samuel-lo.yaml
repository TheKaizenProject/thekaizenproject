  I’m Samuel Lo, a grade 11 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau HS. When I’m not
  out for a run during ungodly hours in the morning or trying to figure out new
  ways to incorporate a rubik’s cube in my presentations, I can be found in my
  natural habitat designing away on Figma or editing videos—usually for The
  Kaizen Project. Feel free to reach out, I’d love to chat!
