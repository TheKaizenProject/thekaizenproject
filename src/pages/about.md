         The Kaizen Project is a podcast discussing student life and career exploration through meaningful conversations with older students, mentors, and industry professionals. The
      podcast and our other initiatives were started last year under Illuminare,
      a Junior Achievement company based in Markham run entirely by a group of
      19 driven highschool students.  

         Illuminare recently won the Company of the Year award from Junior Achievement Central Ontario for placing as the top social enterprise out of the 53 other youth companies and 1100+ other entrepreneurs in the program. As such, core members of The Kaizen Project have stepped up to continue the podcast even after the program has ended and some of our executives have graduated.
