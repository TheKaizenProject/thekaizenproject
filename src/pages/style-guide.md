The Kaizen Project Podcast has just finished itâ€™s first season, where we were fortunately
able to use professional audio recording equipment, try new camera setups, and shoot
in a number sets across the 9 episodes. Positive reactions from the podcast prompted
us to launch 2 live webinar series; Spotlight Minds and Spotlight Pathways. The first
explored the business field, featuring a panel of high level business executives and the
CEO of Variance Marketing as our keynote speaker. The second featured 8 university
students, comparing the top programs in Ontario from the fields of engineering,
computer science, business, and healthcare. In total, we collected over 800 webinar
registrations and 30,000 watch minutes on YouTube and Spotify. With this strong base,
we want to start season 2 of The Kaizen Project in 2021 by expanding into
different styles of videos, forms of content, and exciting campaigns. Our plans include
vlogs, entertaining career breakdowns, a blog, our own facebook group, an alumni
network, and any new ideas our members may bring to the table.
